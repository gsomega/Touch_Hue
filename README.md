# Touch_Hue

This is a python version of a popular phone game "I love Hue".

A gradient of colors are created and scrambled, and the player has to unscramble them to "win".

Several "cards" are locked in location, and locked cards and corner colors can be modified
in settings.py.

Ultimately, it might be nice to randomize the colors, board size, and locked squares to create
a novel experience every time the program is run. 

Additionally, the hope was to use this as a platform for non-color based card-"gradients" to create
more interesting games to play.

Touch_Hue.py is the driver code.  It requires pygame to run.

Enjoy! -Rob
